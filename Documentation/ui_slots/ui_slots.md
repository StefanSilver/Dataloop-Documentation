# UI Slots

## What is an UI Slot?

A UI Slot is extremely useful because it lets you add your own customized function to the platform's interface. Once added, you can call it at any time you want with just one click. Once a UI Slot is activated, users can execute the function using the UI Slot in the Dataset browser, Task browser, or Annotation Studio.

This short guide will teach you how to add UI Slots in Dataloop's web UI.

## Adding an UI Slot

Before you can add a UI Slot, you need to go to the Application Hub. To do that, you need to go to the left side of the screen, and click the `Application (FAAS)` drop-down button. There you will find the Application Hub. Click on it.

To successfully add a UI Slot, you need to follow these steps:
1. First, you need to click the `ADD FUNCTION` button and then pick an Input. In our example we will pick an Item, by clicking the little `+` button at the bottom of the pop-up page that appeared when you pressed the `ADD FUNCTION` button. Without this action, you won’t be able to create UI Slots, so make sure that you do it right. You can see how below.

2. Click the three dots in your function and choose “Add UI Slot”.
3. Pick a module name, and function name.
4. Put a display name (the name will be displayed in the UI).
5. In our case resource type is Item as we defined it when creating FaaS (see previous screenshot).
6. A panel is a place from which you will be able to call your function.

## Places where you can add UI Slots
There are 4 spots in the platform interface where you can call your function manually.
For Datasets - Panel in Dataset Browse
For Items - Annotation Studio
For Tasks - Task Browser
For Annotations - Annotation Studio
