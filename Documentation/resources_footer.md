# Dataloop Resources

Dataloop has a lot of resources from which you can learn about the services we offer. However, it may be difficult to see the whole picture when it comes to where all the resources are, or when you're trying to find something specific. That's why we took care of organising all of them here. 

Below, you will find links to a **mindmap** showing, in a visual way, all of the resources available - each element is clickable and will redirect you to that resource. Also, you will find other Documentation pages and their descriptions, so you know where to look for what you want to learn.

## Resources List

1. [Dataloop's Developer Mindmap](https://gitmind.com/app/docs/m7u63dss) - a visual representation of all the resources available for developers.
2. [Dataloop's Developer Documentation on Redocly](https://developers.dataloop.ai/tutorials/tutorials/) - here you will find a [Beginner Onboarding](https://developers.dataloop.ai/onboarding/onboarding/) which will walk you throught the basics of using Dataloop's platform from the Python SDK, and also an [Advanced Onboarding Exercise](https://developers.dataloop.ai/onboarding/11_onboarding_exercise/) which will show you how to use the platform on a more complicated usecase; [you can also find them on GitHub](https://github.com/dataloop-ai/dtlpy-documentation), if that's your thing.
