    "In Dataloop, an Organization refers to a management entity that provides a context for user accounts and facilitates collaboration, data sharing, and resource management. Here are some key points about Organizations in Dataloop:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creation and Setup:** When setting up an account, an Organization is created and named, and it becomes linked to the account. If an account doesn't have an Organization, the user can contact Dataloop's support team for assistance. It's important to note that additional Organizations cannot be created; however, users can join existing Organizations by requesting the admin of the desired Organization to add them as a member.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sub-Orgs and Client Orgs:** Dataloop allows customers or partners to have their own Organizations. This feature enables service providers to offer services and share projects with their clients. Customers/partners can sign up on the relevant platform, go through the onboarding process, and create their own Organization. As a result, they become annotation managers in the project and can access services, add workforce from their Organization, manage tasks, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Active Organization:** As a member of one or more Organizations, users have an \"Active organization\" context. This means they can view the currently active Organization on the left-side menu. If a user belongs to multiple Organizations, they can switch the active Organization by clicking on the Organization name dropdown list and selecting the desired one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ownership of New Projects:** When creating new projects, they are automatically assigned to the currently active Organization. This ensures that the project's charges and ownership are attributed to the correct Organization. Before opening a new project, users should verify that the active Organization is set correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Organization Overview:** The \"Organization Overview\" section provides a summary of all projects, datasets, tasks, and members within the current active Organization. It can be accessed from the left-side navigation menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Renaming Organization:** Admins and owners of an Organization have the ability to rename it. To do so, they can navigate to the Organization Overview, click on the Ellipsis icon menu item, and choose the \"Rename Org\" option.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setting Paying-Account on Other Projects:** If a labeling service provider needs to account for work and resource consumption on a project owned by a different Organization (e.g., a client's project), they can set their organization's account as the paying subscription. This can be done by adding a user from the service provider organization as a 'Project owner' in the client's project. Then, on the service provider's dashboard, they can locate the project card, click the Ellipsis icon action button, and select \"Set under [your organization name] account.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we will explore all of the methods available for the `dtlpy.organizations` in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** To create an Organization, you must go to the WebUI version of Dataloo (www.dataloop.ai). There was a function previously that allowed you to create an Organization in the Python SDK - but it has since been removed and is unusable. So go to our platform and create one there, if you havent already. An Organization should be created automatically when you first create an account with Dataloop.\n",

    "Dataloop has a lot of resources that can help you learn about the services we offer. However, it may be challenging to have a comprehensive understanding of the location of all resources or to locate something particular that you need. That's why we took care of organising all of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will find links to a **mindmap** showing all of the resources available - each element is clickable and will redirect you to that resource. You will also find other Documentation pages and their descriptions, so you know where to look, and what you'll find.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Dataloop's Developer Mindmap](https://gitmind.com/app/docs/m7u63dss) - a visual representation of all the resources available for developers.\n",
    "2. [Dataloop's Developer Documentation on Redocly](https://developers.dataloop.ai/tutorials/tutorials/) - here you will find a [Beginner Onboarding](https://developers.dataloop.ai/onboarding/onboarding/) which will walk you throught the basics of using Dataloop's platform from the Python SDK, and also an [Advanced Onboarding Exercise](https://developers.dataloop.ai/onboarding/11_onboarding_exercise/) which will show you how to use the platform on a more complicated usecase; [you can also find them on GitHub](https://github.com/dataloop-ai/dtlpy-documentation), if that's your thing.\n",
    "3. [Dataloop's Main GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dataloop-ai) - this repository contains the main dtlpy package, along with its documentation and other resources; this is meant to be a \"clean\" space containing the critical elements of Dataloop.\n",
    "4. [Dataloop's Developer GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dataloop-ai-apps) - this repository contains resources, exercises, examples, documentations, etc. - it's  a Developer Community, which offers resources  from which developers can learn about the platform, ask questions, and find useful code and guides that will solve their problems. \n",
    "5. [Dataloop's API Documentation](https://github.com/dataloop-ai-apps/dataloop-api-documentation) - this documentation is a beginner's guide to how to use Dataloop's Rest APIAPI ([click here to open the Swagger UI API page](https://gate.dataloop.ai/api/v1/docs/#/)); it will walk you through what API's are in general, what Dataloop's API is, how it helps you, why you should use it and teaches you **how** to use it. You can also [find a \"Glossary\" of all API commands here](https://github.com/dataloop-ai-apps/dataloop-api-documentation/blob/main/02_swagger_ui_api_guide.md).\n",
    "6. [Dataloop's WebUI Version](https://console.dataloop.ai/welcome) - remember that you can always use (and should use) the WebUI version of Dataloop; some things are easier to do on the WebUI version, while others are easier to do in the PythonSDK version - so be sure to use both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you have any troubles in your journey to learn and use Dataloop, you can always contact us for help by clicking the small e-mail button located at the bottom right of the [main Dataloop web page](https://dataloop.ai/), or even [book a demo so we can walk you through how to use Dataloop](https://dataloop.ai/#talkToAnExpert).\n"
