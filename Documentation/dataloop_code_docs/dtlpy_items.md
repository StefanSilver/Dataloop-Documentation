## <a name="find_item_id"></a> How to find an Item's ID
The easiest way to find an Item's ID is to actually open the Items inside of the Dataset in the WebUI of Dataloop. To do that, run the code below:
```python
d_set.items.open_in_web()
```
This will open the WebUI of Dataloop, which will show all of the Items you have inside of the Dataset. By clicking one of the Items, you will see its ID. You can see that visually in the image below - the Item ID and Dataset ID are highlighted:
